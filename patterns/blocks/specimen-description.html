      <p class="designer__description">Before starting his career in type, George Ryan spent three years in the US Army, serving in Germany and Vietnam. He was heavily involved in the early development of digital font production tools, working for Bitstream in the 1980s and for Galapagos in the 90s. He calculates that he has spent more than 35 years ‘drawing letters.’ Ryan also has extensive experience as a software programmer and computer network troubleshooter. Since 2004, he has been a type designer at Monotype. Ryan designed the Oz Handicraft typeface, based on the work of Oswald Cooper.</p>
